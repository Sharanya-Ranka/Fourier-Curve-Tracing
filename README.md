# Fourier-Curve-Tracing
Trace curves using Fourier Series

Please read my report to get a more comprehensive idea of the code written here.

Also see this video by 3Blue1Brown. It inspired me to make a similar implementation and attempt to generalise to more dimensions.

[But what is a Fourier Series?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k)

If you do find any mistake in the report/ implementation, or have a better way of implementing it, please tell me (via an issue), it will be greatly appreciated!
